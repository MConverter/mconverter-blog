Martin built the original version of the MConverter API in 2017. What began as a personal hobby project evolved into today's MConverter progressive web app. He leads all things technical: from designing and developing the software to managing servers and keeping the platform running smoothly, while occasionally battling the most obscure bugs. With a passion for bloat-free web development and cybersecurity, he wears every hat needed to bring MConverter to life. Through his writing, he shares insights from building and scaling a tech product, aiming to inspire other developers along the way.
