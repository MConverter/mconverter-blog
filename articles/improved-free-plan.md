You asked for a more affordable file converter, and we listened. In a time when most companies are raising their prices, we’re raising our free limits! Make the most of our higher daily limit and larger batch conversion limit!

## Convert More in a Single Batch

Each free conversion batch can now include up to 8 files instead of just 2. This way, you can process larger groups of files at once and avoid the constant back-and-forth of uploading small sets. Make your workflow smoother and far less frustrating with fewer clicks, as you no longer have to keep track of converted vs. non-converted files as much.

## Boosted Daily Limit

We’ve decided to set a new record by having the largest free daily limit among all major converter websites: 15 conversions every 24 hours. This new daily limit allows you to get more work done than ever before, completely for free.

As you may expect, we fund our Free Plan through advertising to keep it available to everyone. For this reason, if you use addons that restrict displaying ads on our web app, your daily limit may be temporarily reduced. You can always restore the full free limit by allowing ads on MConverter, or get rid of all limits with our paid plans.

## So, What’s the Catch?

There is none! Whether you have a subscription, use a daily pass, or convert for free, we always provide high quality conversions that follow the same [security and privacy practices](https://mconverter.eu/#trust): no scanning or sharing your files, and automatic deletion shortly after the conversion completes.

We’ve been able to optimise our expenses, so that we can give more for free. As a result, we’re moving closer to our core mission of offering convenient, high quality, fast, and secure conversions for all, without annoyances and unnecessary restrictions. The free daily limit of 15 files, combined with a batch conversion limit of 8 files, makes MConverter one of the most efficient web apps for quick and urgent conversions.
