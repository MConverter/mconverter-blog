The MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14) file format is one of the most common digital multimedia formats used today. It is known best for its high-quality compression and compatibility with various devices and operating systems. 

This includes macOS, which is natively supported by the built-in QuickTime Player. Users often face issues like unsupported codecs, playback errors, or lagging videos. 

This article is your ultimate guide on how to open MP4 on Mac without QuickTime, exploring different player options and how to convert MP4 files to other formats for seamless playback.

## How to Convert MP4 Video to a Different Format

[Converting an MP4 video](https://mconverter.eu/convert/mp4/) to a different format is often needed when some devices or players don’t support certain codecs. You might also have to convert the file when you need to reduce its size, or you want a better format with faster loading times. 

In all cases, there are several great options you can choose:

* **MConverter:** This application lets you convert files online in bulk while supporting numerous media and document formats.
