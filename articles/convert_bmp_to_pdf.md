##What is a BMP file?
So, are you wondering what's a bmp file and why it needs to be converted? In this section we will explain just that.

BMP file was created by Microsoft for the purpose of avoiding the image resolution from getting hampered or changed when viewed on different screens or on different devices. These images are not compressed, which means that they take a lot of space, and would need to be compressed to make storage more efficient. As microsoft describes it, this is a standard image format utilized on Windows for the goal of storing device-independent and application-independent images. 

##Specifics of BMP file type
A BMP file contains a few elements which users might want to be informed about. The following are the main elements that make up a BMP file:

This can be equal to 1, 4, 8,15, 24, 32, or 64 bits per pixel, however, 24 bits per pixel is the most common. This header represents the bitmap identifier, along with the width, height, and color settings of the file.
