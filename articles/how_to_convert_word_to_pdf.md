MS Word, a processor developed by Microsoft, is one of the most widely used programs of the Microsoft Office Suite. MS Word was created by Charles Simonyi and Richard Brodie - two software engineers in 1983. Fast forward to the present times, Microsoft Word has over 750 million active users and is also something that a lot of Fortune 500 companies rely on. MS Word has several characteristics, one of which is its extension. 

The extension for any word file is .DOC or .docx. Many people want to convert DOC files to PDF or other formats but are unable to do so. But, a little knowledge and the right tool go a long way in facilitating the conversion of different computer files from one format to another. So, join us, as we explore the basics of a DOC file and understand how to convert DOC to PDF format.

## What is a DOC file?

In a nutshell, a DOC file is a word processing document created using Microsoft Word or exported from another word processing application, such as OpenOffice Writer or Apple Pages. 
A DOC file may contain formatted texts, tables, graphs, images, charts, and more. We use DOC files to create documents, such as letters, essays, assignments, etc. Its relevance persists in all domains, including professional spaces, business, academia, domestic tasks, etc. .doc is the filename extension for word processing documents stored on MS Word. It was the primary format for MS Word until the 2007 version replaced it with Office Open XML .docx files.

Now that we know what a DOC file is, let us check out its advantages and disadvantages. 

## Advantages of DOC files

A DOC file has several advantages. For starters, you can easily convert a DOC to PDF and other formats and also align the Document for printing. But, there are other advantages, which deserve their due recognition. These include:

### Editability

DOC files can be easily edited, which makes working extremely easy. Besides, the fact that you can work on DOC files offline further streamlines the accessibility and editability factor.

### Formatting options

The second major advantage of a [DOC file](https://mconverter.eu/convert/doc/) is the availability of advanced formatting options. DOC files allow complex formatting, such as headers, tables, footers, referencing, custom styles, etc. The simple interface and UI make it easier to leverage these formatting options.

## Disadvantages of DOC files

Like everything else in the world, DOC files also come with their fair share of demerits. These include:

### Inconsistency across platforms

A DOC file does not ensure consistency across different platforms. When your file is saved in the .docx extension and is transferred to another device, then the layout, formatting, spacing, etc, might change completely. Therefore, it is advised to convert DOC to PDF before wrapping up the entire project or work.

### Unsecure

The second demerit of a DOC file is that it is not secure. DOC files are not encrypted or protected via any security mechanisms and can be opened with a simple tap. This makes things more complicated, especially if you are working on a sensitive project.

## Advantages of PDF files

Now, let us check out the merits that PDFs offer.

### Consistency

PDFs ensure consistency across devices. When you transfer a PDF file from one device to another, the layout, formatting, text size, spacing, etc, do not move. Thus, a PDF is a great format when you want to finalize a draft. Hence, it is common for students to convert a DOC to PDF while finalizing their assignments and sending it to the concerned professor. 

### Security

PDFs have a high level of security. They are, in fact, one of the most trusted document formats and are even used by legal professionals. Moreover, PDFs are also recognisable in court because any alterations done to a PDF can be traced. You can also determine the viewing access of a PDF by setting up password protection.

## Disadvantages of PDF files

### Software requirements

The biggest disadvantage of a PDF file is that it needs special software to be accessed. Not every basic device supports the viewing and editing of PDFs. 

### Limited editability

The greatest limitation, which is also a blessing in disguise, is that PDFs have limited editability. Usually, it is not possible to edit PDFs for free and you would need to use a paid platform like Adobe Acrobat to edit a PDF.
