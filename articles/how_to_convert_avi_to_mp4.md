## What is the AVI format?
The AVI format, the acronym for Audio Video Interleave, is a multimedia container format that stores both video and audio data in a single file. It was first launched by Microsoft in 1992, as part of its Video for Windows technology. The [AVI format](https://mconverter.eu/convert/avi/) is based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) – a container format that stores multimedia data by dividing the file into blocks or chunks.
AVI files can support multiple streaming of both audio and video, but this feature is seldom put to use. Moreover, an AVI file format is typically less compressed than other, more popular ones like MOV and MPEG. This implies that they take up more space but also boast much higher quality and audio fidelity than their counterparts. Currently, AVI is an incredibly popular file format on the internet for video distribution.
