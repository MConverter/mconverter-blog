## What is a 3GP file?
A 3GP file is a video format developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), specifically for 3G-enabled devices. This multimedia file format comprises video streams of AMR or AAC-based audio streams and H.263 or H.264 codecs, which are great for lossy video compressions.

Being a multimedia container, a 3GP file can efficiently store and playback video and audio files on mobile devices. A 3GP file format is primarily useful for compressing video and audio content to make them play back seamlessly over 3G mobile networks. 3GP files are designed to retain reasonable video and audio quality even at low bit rates.

## How to convert 3GP files?
You can easily convert a 3GP video format into other video or audio file formats. You can either use an online converter or install an application or software for quick video conversions. To select an efficient converting tool, use search terms like “[how to convert .3gp to mp4](https://mconverter.eu/convert/3gp/)” or “online 3GP converter” on the web.

Upload your 3GP video in the uploading space provided. There will be an option for “Choose Files” or “Upload Files”.

### Select Output Settings
Next, select or modify your desired output settings. You will be asked to choose your preferred audio quality, video resolution, file size, and output file type.

### Preview and Download
Finally, click the ‘Download’ button, and your converted file will start downloading automatically. You can also preview the converted file before downloading. Based on this preview, you can modify your output settings if required. Some converters will start the downloading process instantly without requiring you to select a “Download” button, making the conversion process faster.
