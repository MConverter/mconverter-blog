A file format can be defined as the way data is logically arranged within a file. It is the standard method of storing data on a computer file and specifies how bits encode information in a digital storage medium. There are various types of file formats, some are common while others are more obscure. One rather uncommon yet important file format is FLAC. In this blog, we will delve into the basics of the **FLAC file** format and understand how to convert it to MP3.

## What is a FLAC file?

In a nutshell, a FLAC file is an audio file encoded using the open-source, lossless audio compression standard known as the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC). Comparable to an MP3 file, a FLAC file is compressed without sacrificing any of the original audio data's quality. The primary highlight of a **FLAC file** is that it is lossless, meaning that no sound quality is lost during compression. This trait is unlike other popular audio compression formats like MP3 and WMA. You can convert a **[FLAC to MP3](https://mconverter.eu/convert/flac/mp3/)** and other formats with the help of a converter.

## Specifics of FLAC files

Some of the specifics of FLAC files are:

- **Lossless**<br>The most distinct trait of FLAC files is that they preserve all audio details from the original recording.

- **High Resolution**<br>FLAC supports bit depths and sampling rates that satisfy high resolution audio desires.

- **Compatibility**<br>Most modern digital devices, such as Android smartphones, tablets, and iPhones, support FLAC playback.

- **Larger File Size**<br>Owing to its lossless nature, [FLAC files](https://mconverter.eu/convert/flac/) are significantly larger than MP3 files.

- **Bluetooth Consideration**<br>Lastly, a pertinent characteristic of a FLAC file is when using Bluetooth, FLAC files will not remain lossless due to Bluetooth codecs.

Now that we have touched upon the basics of a FLAC file, let us understand how it is different from MP3.

## Difference between FLAC and MP3

There are various differences between FLAC and MP3. Let us check out these distinctions in detail. 

### Compression and quality

FLAC is a lossless format that retains all the original audio data. In other words, when you compress an audio file using FLAC, no sound quality is lost. Conversely, MP3 is a lossy format, meaning that some audio data is lost during compression.

### File size

FLAC files ensure amazing sound quality, but they have a larger file size that can cause problems. In such a context, you can opt for MConverter's **FLAC to MP3 converter**. On the contrary, MP3 has smaller file sizes but sacrifices some audio quality in the process.

### Compatibility

FLAC files are not compatible with all types of hardware and digital devices. On the other hand, MP3 has wider hardware support and compatibility than FLAC. In case of unsupported hardware, you can opt for a FLAC converter. 

After a crisp overview of the difference between FLAC and MP3, let us check out how to convert [FLAC to MP3](https://mconverter.eu/convert/flac/mp3/).
