At MConverter, we have made it easy for you to cancel your subscription. We do **not** make it purposefully difficult by having you call a phone number and wait, **nor** do we charge cancellation fees.

To stop your subscription from auto-renewing (i.e. to cancel it), follow these steps:
1. Sign in with the account you used to subscribe to MConverter Premium, Plus, or Pro.
    - On desktop, click on the account icon at the top right corner.
    - On mobile, tap on MENU > SIGN IN.
2. Go to **[My Account](#account)** after signing in, or if you are already logged into your account.
    - On desktop, click on the account icon at the top right corner.
    - On mobile, tap on MENU > MY ACCOUNT.
3. Click on the **MANAGE SUBSCRIPTION** button. It may also be called **MANAGE PAYMENTS**.
4. Tap on **Cancel Plan** in the popup window that opens.
    - After cancelling, your paid plan benefits will remain active for the rest of the current billing period.
    - We'd appreciate it if you let us know why you're cancelling, though you are not required to specify a reason when unsubscribing.

We are sorry to see you go. If you have any questions, we're here to help: [contact us](#legal).

## I can't see any active plans, but I'm still getting charged. Why?

You have probably used a different email address when signing up. Please try logging in with any other email accounts you have and look for the **MANAGE SUBSCRIPTION** button.

If this doesn't help, contact us and mention your name, the date(s) you were charged, and/or the last 4 digits of your card. This way, we will be able to find and cancel your subscription.
