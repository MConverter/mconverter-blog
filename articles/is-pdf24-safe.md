Yes, PDF24 is safe to use. It encrypts file transfers to keep documents secure, offers a desktop version so files can be processed entirely offline, and has no record of serious security incidents. Students, freelancers, and small businesses often rely on it for merging, converting, and compressing PDFs without security concerns.

A [file converter](https://mconverter.eu/)’s security involves more than encryption alone. PDF24 automatically deletes uploaded files after processing, limits how long data remains on its servers, and gives users full control when working with sensitive documents offline. 

Whilst it is not designed as a high-security enterprise platform, it delivers a balance between privacy and convenience that works well for most everyday document needs.

Later in my article, I will also introduce a safer alternative for users who want stronger security features or additional privacy controls, so you can make a more informed decision about which tool fits your needs best.

## **What Is PDF24?**

PDF24 is a free PDF toolset developed by Geek Software GmbH, a German company known for creating lightweight, user-friendly software. The platform provides both a web version and a desktop application, covering a wide range of PDF needs such as merging, splitting, compressing, converting, and protecting files with passwords.

![PDF24 review](image6.webp)

What sets PDF24 apart from many other online PDF tools is its strong focus on **offline functionality**. The desktop version allows users to process documents without uploading them to external servers, giving more control over privacy and security. 

In addition, this feature alone makes it popular among people who handle sensitive information or simply prefer to keep files on their own devices.

The web version, on the other hand, offers quick access to PDF tools from any browser, which works well for casual users or those who need to edit or convert documents on the go. 

There is no steep learning curve and a simple interface; PDF24 has grown into one of the most widely used free PDF solutions in Europe and beyond.

##  **Is PDF24 Safe to Use in 2025?**

Evaluating the safety of PDF24 means looking closely at how it handles files, what security measures are built into the platform, and how much control users keep over their data. 

Since PDF24 offers both a **desktop application** and **online tools**, each with different privacy implications, understanding the strengths and limitations of both helps you decide which option works best for your needs.

The desktop application appeals to people who want all work handled locally on their own devices. The online tools serve those who need quick access from anywhere without installing software. 

Both versions come with specific security features designed to protect documents and reduce unnecessary risks. To figure out how, let’s dive deeper.

### **Desktop App Safety**

The desktop version of PDF24 processes every file on the user’s own computer. Nothing is uploaded to external servers, which removes the usual risks linked to cloud-based processing. When documents stay within the local environment, exposure to breaches or unauthorized access decreases significantly.

Security specialists often recommend local processing for sensitive information such as financial records, client contracts, or internal reports. PDF24’s desktop app gives users full control, ensuring no third-party infrastructure ever handles their data.

![image2](image11.webp)

The only precaution involves downloading the installer directly from PDF24’s official website. Installing software **from unofficial sources** can expose users to malware or altered versions that compromise security.

Regular software updates from the developer also play a role in keeping the desktop app secure. Installing the latest version ensures vulnerabilities found in older releases are fixed quickly, keeping the system aligned with modern security practices.

### **Online Tool Safety**

The online version of PDF24 provides speed and accessibility for people who prefer working directly in a browser. All file transfers use HTTPS encryption, which protects documents while they move between a user’s device and the platform’s servers.

After processing, files are automatically deleted within a short window, so no document remains stored longer than necessary. Students uploading assignments or small businesses converting reports often find this level of protection sufficient for routine tasks.

![image3](image13.webp)

However, professionals handling highly confidential data or organizations bound by strict compliance requirements may prefer offline solutions to avoid sending files through external servers at all.

### **Privacy and Data Security**

PDF24 operates under European data protection laws, including the **GDPR**. These laws require transparency around data handling, clear deletion policies, and strict limits on storage times. 

According to the platform’s privacy policy, documents are used only for the requested task and are removed soon after processing.

![image4](image4.webp)

Users who want maximum privacy often choose the desktop version because no data ever leaves the computer. The combination of GDPR compliance, automatic file deletion, encrypted transfers, and local processing options makes PDF24 a dependable tool for most individuals and businesses handling everyday document work.

## **Reliability of PDF24 in 2025**

Reliability means more to me than just whether a tool works. It is about how consistently it performs day after day, no matter if it handles big tasks as smoothly as small ones, and if people can trust it for both personal and professional work. 

After spending time with PDF24 in 2025, I can see why so many users rely on it year after year. Looking at performance, the overall experience, and how well it fits into business workflows gives a full picture of what to expect.

### **Performance and Efficiency**

I have tested PDF24 with everything from small student assignments to large, image-heavy reports. The desktop version processes files right on the computer, so I never had to worry about internet speed or server delays. 

Moreover, merging ten separate reports into one document took seconds, and even converting big presentations to PDFs did not slow the system down.

What stands out is how **consistent** it feels. Some tools get slower over time as they add more features, but PDF24 stays focused on speed and reliability. Regular updates fix minor issues, keep it compatible with new operating systems, and ensure it continues to run smoothly. 

When I was working on heavier tasks, such as compressing dozens of files at once, the desktop app handled everything without freezing or crashing!

The online tools are almost as quick for small to medium files. Uploading a single document to convert or compress works fast, though I did notice **some delays** during busy hours when many people were likely using the service. 

Anyhow, switching to the desktop app solved that problem immediately, which shows why having both options matters.

### **User Experience and Trustworthiness**

I like how straightforward PDF24 feels the moment you open it. The layout is clean, tools are clearly labeled, and I never waste time figuring out where to click next. 

Converting, merging, or compressing files takes only a few steps, which makes the whole experience fast and frustration-free.

![image5](image10.webp)

What also stands out is the **lack of aggressive advertising** or constant reminders to upgrade. Many free tools throw pop-ups in your face or hide basic features behind confusing paywalls. PDF24 keeps everything simple so you can focus on finishing your work rather than closing unnecessary prompts.

Not everything is perfect, though. I noticed one user review mentioning that editing text inside PDFs is not available in the free version. They expected to change the text directly, which **PDF24 does not support**. 

Whilst that might disappoint people looking for a full PDF editor, it does not affect the main strengths like conversion speed, compression quality, or file security.

![image6](image12.webp)

Over the years, PDF24 has earned trust because it consistently does what it promises without unpleasant surprises. I also appreciate knowing I can keep everything offline using the desktop app when handling documents that should stay private. 

Overall, it feels reliable enough to use regularly without second-guessing whether files are safe or if the software will crash mid-task.

### **Business Suitability**

Small businesses, freelancers, and remote teams often need tools that are easy to learn and dependable under tight deadlines. As I explored its features, PDF24 fits that role well. Teams can merge contracts, prepare invoices, and convert proposals without running into performance issues or complicated settings.

The desktop app in particular appeals to businesses handling private data because nothing leaves the computer. Companies without strict compliance requirements often find it good enough for day-to-day document workflows, especially when budgets are tight.

Anyway, industries with heavier regulations, such as finance or healthcare, might want software with certifications or advanced access controls. PDF24 focuses on reliability and ease of use rather than enterprise-grade security features. 

From my perspective, startups and small companies benefit the most. They can stay productive, cut software costs, and keep control over their documents without needing a complex setup.

## **Common Concerns About PDF24**

Even though PDF24 works well for most users, a few concerns come up in reviews. Some people expect full editing features, including text changes inside PDFs, and feel limited when they find the platform mainly focuses on merging, compressing, and converting files.

Others, like one reviewer who rated it four stars, mention uncertainty about what happens to files uploaded through the online version. The desktop app avoids this issue since everything stays on the user’s computer, but some people using the web tools want clearer details about data handling and deletion policies.

![image8](image9.webp)

A few users also note **slower speeds** during peak hours and wish for more advanced security options for business use. For all that, the overall feedback shows most people see PDF24 as reliable and practical for everyday tasks despite these points.

## **Expert Opinions on PDF24 Safety**

Cybersecurity professionals generally view PDF24 as a safe platform for everyday document tasks. Many highlight the advantage of having both an online version and a desktop app.

Furthermore, the online tools use encrypted connections and automatic file deletion policies, while the desktop version keeps everything local, removing the risks linked to sending files over the internet.

Experts often recommend the desktop app for people handling sensitive or confidential files. Local processing means documents never leave the user’s device, which aligns with best practices for reducing exposure to potential breaches.

Some security reviewers also point out that PDF24 complies with **European privacy regulations**, including GDPR, which require clear rules on how user data is stored, processed, and deleted. 

Although the platform **does not aim** for enterprise-grade certifications like HIPAA or ISO 27001, specialists note that it provides enough safeguards for typical personal and small business use.

The consensus among experts is straightforward: PDF24 is secure for most users as long as its online tools are used for non-sensitive documents and the desktop version is chosen when working with private or regulated information.

## **Best Practices to Use PDF24 Safely**

Over time, I have learned that even reliable tools deliver the best results when you follow a few simple habits. Using the platform safely is not complicated, but it does take a bit of awareness about where you download it, how you work with files online, and what choices you make when processing sensitive information. 

After testing PDF24 in different situations, here is what has worked best for me and what I recommend to others.

### **Safe Download and Installation**

The first thing I always do is download PDF24 directly from the **official website**. It may sound obvious, but third-party sites sometimes bundle extra software or distribute outdated versions that can create unnecessary risks. 

![image8](image1.webp)

Before installing, I make sure my operating system is updated and my antivirus software is running. A quick security scan takes only a moment and gives peace of mind before opening any installer.

During installation, I read every prompt instead of clicking through quickly. Some programs sneak in extra components when you rush, so I prefer a clean setup with only the core features I actually need. 

Also, I keep an eye on updates after installing PDF24. Each release usually brings small performance improvements and fixes potential vulnerabilities, so staying current helps keep everything secure and stable.

### **Secure Online Usage**

I prefer using the web version on a private, password-protected network rather than public Wi-Fi. PDF24 encrypts files during transfer, but sticking to a secure connection lowers any remaining risk. 

After processing a document, I usually **delete it manually** instead of relying only on automatic deletion. It takes just a few clicks and ensures nothing stays on the server longer than necessary.

The web version handles tasks like compressing lecture notes or merging reports well, though I turn to the desktop app for larger projects or documents containing personal information. Processing everything offline keeps files fully under my control and prevents sensitive data from passing through external servers.

### **Alternative for Sensitive Documents**

Some projects involve documents that require stricter privacy controls, such as financial records or legal contracts. In those situations, the best option is our tool [MConverter](https://mconverter.eu/), designed specifically to prioritize data security, which stands out as the strongest choice.

![MConverter](image3.webp)

MConverter combines security, speed, and transparency in a way many other tools cannot match. Files are transferred through encrypted connections, processed quickly, and automatically deleted after a short period. Manual deletion is also available for users who want immediate control over file removal.

Handling large workloads becomes simple as well. Batch processing allows multiple files to be converted at once without constant supervision, and the interface stays consistent across both desktop and mobile devices. 

Besides, there are **no intrusive ads** or **unnecessary menus**, only a straightforward, reliable experience supported by clear privacy policies.

![MConverter features](image8.webp)

Sensitive documents that cannot remain online longer than necessary benefit from the security and control MConverter provides. 

To sum up, our platform delivers a **level of protection** that most online tools, including PDF24, are not built to offer, making it the best choice for managing private information.

## **The Bottom Line**

Spending time with PDF24 shows why so many people rely on it year after year. The platform offers a balance of convenience, performance, and privacy options that cover the needs of students, freelancers, and small businesses.

Additionally, the desktop version in particular gives users full control by keeping everything offline, which makes it a practical choice for people handling private information but not bound by strict industry regulations. Those with heavier security requirements, such as legal, healthcare, or financial professionals, might still prefer tools with enterprise-level certifications.

Anyone looking for stronger privacy protections combined with speed and flexibility should consider **MConverter as the best alternative**. It offers encrypted file transfers, quick processing, automatic and manual deletion options, and reliable batch conversion without sacrificing usability.

Overall, PDF24 is dependable for most document workflows, while MConverter becomes the smarter choice whenever security and data control matter most.

## **Does PDF24 Store Uploaded Files Permanently?**

No, PDF24 does not store uploaded files permanently. Documents processed through the online tools are automatically deleted from the servers shortly after the task is completed. Users can also remove files manually right away if they prefer full control over timing. 

Those who want to avoid any online storage entirely can use the desktop version, where all processing happens locally on the computer without sending files to external servers at all.

## **Is PDF24 Safe for Confidential Business Documents?**

PDF24 offers secure file transfers with encryption and automatic deletion for documents processed through the online version, which is generally safe for standard business tasks. 

However, highly confidential materials such as client contracts, financial records, or regulated industry documents are best handled using the desktop application. Processing everything locally keeps files on your own computer and avoids any risk associated with online storage.

## **Does PDF24 Sell or Share User Data?**

PDF24 states in its privacy policy that user data is not sold or shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Files processed through the platform are used only for the requested tasks and are automatically deleted after a short time. 

Users looking for maximum privacy can rely on the desktop version, where documents stay entirely on the local computer without passing through any external servers.

## **Is PDF24 GDPR-Compliant?**

Yes, PDF24 follows the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The platform is developed in Germany, so it must meet strict European privacy laws regarding data handling, storage, and user rights. Files processed online are encrypted during transfer and deleted shortly after the task is complete, while the desktop version keeps all documents on the user’s computer for maximum control.

## **Has PDF24 Ever Been Hacked?**

No public reports indicate that PDF24 has ever experienced a data breach or hacking incident. The platform uses encrypted connections for file transfers and deletes uploaded documents shortly after processing, which reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
