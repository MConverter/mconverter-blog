A HEIC file contains one or more images saved in the High-Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), a file format that is most commonly used to store photos on iOS devices. An image or series of images, most likely taken with the camera app on an iPhone or iPad, are stored in HEIC files along with the metadata that describes each image. Naturally, HEIC files are saved most frequently with the .heic extension, though they can also be saved as .Heif files. Many people enjoy the quality assured by [HEIC files](https://mconverter.eu/convert/heic/) but often do not understand how to convert them into the JPG format. If this sounds helpful to you, then join us, as we check out the nitty-gritty of how to convert HEIC files to JPG in three ways.

## Heic file specifics
Before delving into the basics of how to convert HEIC files into JPG, let us understand the HEIC file format and extension in more detail.

### Heic file format

The HEIC file is a tad bit similar to other image files, such as JPEGs or PNGs. However, the critical difference is that HEIC image files are encoded using HEVC, which is most commonly leveraged to compress videos and save data. So, in practice, this implies that images with HEIC formats do not take up much space and are quite high quality. The HEIF image format is the default one used by Apple's iPhone and iPad to take pictures.

### Heic file extension

The HEIC photos have the HEIC file extension. Other alternatives for the .HEIC extension includes .Heif, .heics, .avci, .HIF, etc. Nowadays, Windows also supports images in the HEIF and HEIC format, which was not the case early. However, to open HEIC images on Windows, a special paid plugin from the Microsoft Store is required, called “HEVC Video Extensions.”
Furthermore, if the Apple ecosystem’s user shares an image with a non-iPhone user or to a social media platform, the HEIF image is directly converted into a JPEG image. But, if the conversion does not happen automatically, you can take the assistance of a HEIC [image converter](https://mconverter.eu/converter/image/) like MConverter.
