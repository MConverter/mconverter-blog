MConverter has a [setting](#settings) to automatically download your files once they have finished converting. However, browser policies and restrictions may prevent it from working by default. In this article, we have compiled a list of solutions to fix this issue.

## How do you access MConverter?

To diagnose which solution will work for you, first we need to know how you access MConverter to convert files:

### Using the mconverter.eu website

If you use a browser to load mconverter.eu directly, proceed with the instructions for your browser below.

### Using the Android app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.mconverter.twa) or [Galaxy Store](https://galaxy.store/mconv)

Follow the instructions below for your default browser.

To find out which is your default browser on Android, go to Settings > Apps > Default apps > Browser app. The steps may differ slightly based on the device manufacturer.

### Using the Windows app from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N4F69HXK2LP)

Follow the instructions for Microsoft Edge.
