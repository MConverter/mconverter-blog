## What is the WMA file format?

The WMA file format, which is an acronym for Windows Media Audio, is a type of audio file format that was developed by Microsoft in 1999. WMA is known to efficiently compress audio data while maintaining amazing sound quality. So, if your favorite song is stored on your computer and saved in the WMA format, its file size will be smaller compared to other formats, which means that downloading, managing, and transferring the audio file is easier and faster. Moreover, you can also adjust the bitrate of a WMA file to find the optimal balance between file size and sound quality.

Developed by Windows, WMA is compatible with Windows Media Player and most Windows devices. But, it is essential to note that, unlike other formats, WMA is not universally and 100 percent compatible with the iOS and Android operating systems. The WMA audio extension has its fair share of pros and cons. But, it emerges as a respite if your end goal is to save storage space.

## What is an MP3 file format?

Any blog talking about audio files and formats is quite incomplete without a discussion on the MP3 format. MP3 is among the most commonly distributed audio files and was originally developed in the early 1990s by the Fraunhofer Society of Germany. An MP3 file uses a compression algorithm to reduce the overall file size. It is a ‘lossy format,’ as some of the data is irreversibly lost during compression. However, MP3 formats ensure a fairly decent audio quality. One of the most interesting aspects of MP3 conversion is that it removes those parts of audio that human ears have a harder time hearing, such as the highest and the lowest ends. Hence, the average music buff does not usually notice quality deterioration.
